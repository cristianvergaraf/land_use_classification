<h3 style = "font-weight:800;"> Introduction</h3>

Land use/cover change is one of the key variables to analyze in order to mantain earth within its healthy Planetary Boundaries. This can be study thanks to the development of satellites, which have provided time series of images since 1970s (starting with Landsat 1). Using machine learning algorithms, we can classify pixels into land use/cover classes based on their spectral behavior across different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. 

In this example the Lingue basin in south-central Chile was classified into seven different land use/cover classes. We compared the performance of four different algorithms.

Download images from Google Earth Engine using simple javaScript.

A training set  was generated by selecting sites through photointerpretation of high-resolution images (Google Earth). The selected classes were natural forest, forest plantation, shrubland, agriculture, urban, and water.

Since the reflectance values were already scaled from 0 to 1, additional scaling was unnecessary. The distribution of bandas, separability of classes, and identification of outliers were performed to assess the training sites.

Three different machine algorithms were compared to determine which performed best for this task, considering the small and imbalanced number of training sites.

The models were applied to predict the land use/cover classes for the entire image. Rasterio was used to manage the image and transform it into an array, enabling model application. The results were then converted back to an image and exported.

<h3 style = "font-weight:800;"> Model Validation</h3>

In the remote sensing community, validation is typically performed with new data obtained from the classification. These points are then compared to ground truth data.
