Land use cover change is one of the main threat to the biosphere. In this project I have sucessfully use the following skills.

* Data extraction from google earth engine
* Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
* Test different machine learning algoriths 
* Appy models to predict land use cover based on the reflectance values of the different Bands. 
* Assessment of the results
